This is an experiment in learning Rust. It is, eventually, to be an island
survival game, drawing inspiration from Rimworld, The Sims, and Minecraft.
And also, a basic engine for that game, which might be extensible to other
things I feel like playing with.

This crate is currently a binary, but the plan is to split this into an
engine and a game — or maybe eventually several games — which use that
engine.
